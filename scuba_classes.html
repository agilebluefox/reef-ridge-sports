									<h2>PADI Certification Classes</h2>
									<p>Classes scheduled on demand and at your convenience.</p>
								</header>
								
								<span class="image featured"><img src="images/banner.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								
								<p>Have you ever wanted to experience the pleasure of scuba diving? Well, now you can. We provide scuba certification training on demand and at your convenience. All of our certification courses are taught by certified PADI Instructors and our class sizes are small to ensure you get the attention you deserve. Contact us for more information or just stop by our shop to get started today!</p>
								
								<h3>Open Water Diver - $500</h3>
								<p>If you're interested in learning to scuba dive then this is where you'll start. You'll need some adequate swimming skills and will have to be in good health, but no prior experience with scuba diving is required. You'll also have to be at least 10 years old or older. We have classes that start on demand from one to up to four students at a time. </p>
                <p>This course is made up of three parts: the PADI e-learning kit, three (3) pool training sessions, and four (4) open water training dives. Each part can be done independently and we can accommodate your schedule as your progress through the certification process.  To get started, just stop by our shop and get registered to begin the online learning course through PADI, Professional Association of Diving Instructors. Once you're wrapping up with the first few online modules you can begin practicing some of the skills you're learning in the pool training sessions. This provides a safe environment for you to get more comfortable using your scuba gear and gain experience using your skills under water. Finally, when your online training and pool sessions are complete, you'll finish your certification requirements by performing a few open water dives to explore and use your new skills. </p>
                <p>For this course, you'll need to provide a snorkel, mask, and fins. All of the scuba equipment, including the regulator, buoyancy control device, and tank, will be provided by us. However, if you need to rent any additional equipment then let us know. We can provide what you need for an additional fee.</p>

                <h3>Scuba Review - $100</h3>
								<p>For those of you that have already received a diving certification, but you haven't been diving recently, you can brush up on your skills with the Scuba Review course. Your tune-up will include a chance to review some of the information you previously learned using PADI's interactive online learning program. You'll also be able to practice your scuba diving skills, such as your predive safety check and buoyancy control, in a nearby swimming pool. </p>


                <h3>Advanced Open Water Diver - $150</h3>
								<p>So, you've completed your Open Water Diver certification, you're at least 12 years old, and you're eager to advance your diving skills, increase your confidence, and experience even more adventure under the water. If that's the case, then the Advanced Open Water Diver certification is for you. In this course, you'll complete a total of five (5) dives, two of which will involve Deep and Underwater Navigation - you'll choose the other three.</p>
                <p>This course teaches you how to plan dives to cope with the physiological effects and challenges of deeper scuba diving. The Underwater Navigation Adventure Dive refines your compass navigation skills and helps you better navigate using kick-cycles, visual landmarks, and time. There will be other topics, as well, to allow you a chance to explore your own interests. Contact us to discuss the gear you'll need to start your adventures under the water.</p>


                <h3>Rescue Diver - $250</h3>
								<p>If you're an Advanced Open Water Diver who is at least 12 years old and has completed your Underwater Navigation Adventure Dive then you may enroll in a Rescue Diver course. You'll also need to have completed a CPR and First Aid training course within 24 months.</p>
                <p>In this course you'll become prepared to deal with various types of dive emergencies. Your training will include rescue scenarios which will teach you to handle problems such as recognizing and managing stress in other divers, rescuing panicked or unresponsive divers, and the basics of emergency management. You'll even learn how to rescue yourself if the need should arise. This course will help familiarize you with rescue equipment such as an oxygen unit, floats, and marker buoys.</p>

                <h3>Divemaster - $399</h3>
								<p>Are you thinking of making scuba diving a career? The PADI Divemaster course teaches you how to be a leader and take charge of dive activities. To start your certification you'll need to be at least 18 years old, have a current CPR and First Aid certification, and logged at least 40 dives (you'll need a total of 60 dives to earn your certification). To complete your certification you'll participate in knowledge development sessions, waterskills exercises and workshops, and a hands-on practical assessment. </p>
